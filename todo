Preform Ops to evaluate truth values
    -Done test further
    -How to deal with ~x, set x to false or leave for manipulation rules

Add Manipulation rules
    -in place replacements?

Add Theorem importing
    -Theorems should act as rules as well

Add FOL


FUTURE WARNINGS:
    -Object Entabglement

Peano 
    - Need to define equality 
    - Formalize s ?
        - Unification ?


Prove commutatitive addition
x + s(y) = s(x + y)
x + 0 = x
-----
0 + x = x 
bc: 0 + 0 = 0 :)
IH: 0 + x = x show 0 + s(x) = s(x)
0 + s(x) = s(0 + x) = s(x)
QED
----------------------
s(x) + y = s(x + y)
s(x) + 0 = s(x) = s(x + 0) :)
IH: s(x) + y = s(x + y)  Show s(x) + s(y) = s(x + s(y))
s(x) + s(y) = s(s(x) + y) = s( s(x+y) ) = s(x + s(y))
QED
----------------------
x+y = y+x
BC x + 0 = x ; 0 + x = x ; x+0 = 0+x
IH x + y = y + x , show x + s(y) = s(y) + x
x + s(y) = s(x + y) = s(y + x) = s(y) + s(x)
QED
----------------------
