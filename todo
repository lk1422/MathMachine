TODO:
    -Write Evaluator for new Show, From, Conclude Regimine.
        -Including proof dependency tracker, IE what root statements a proof
        follows from

    -Add System to begin archive new Theorems when proven
        * theorems/theorem_sub_class/.../theorem_name
        * When THM is verified:
            *Add THM to rules/theorems/theorem_sub_class/.../theorem_name
            *This Theorem can then be used in future proofs via the rule

    -Add predicate calculus theorems
        *Pf by contradiction
        *Associativity, Distributive, Demorgans, ...

    -Update Frontend & Backend to allow for custom symbols + definitions
        *Need for Peano Axioms

    -Update Frontend & Backend to support FOL
        *Universal, Existential Quantifiers

    -Make mathmachine manage projects,
        -Do not need to run in project directory
            *`mm create project`
                *Creates necessary project structure (axiomatic file)
                    *All projects begin with a base of predicate calculus & FOL
                    

    -Begin w/ Peano Axioms

FUTURE TODOS:
    -Comments

    -better error catching system for frontend
        *More descriptive parser & lexer errors

    -Stacktrace for backend evaluator?

    -Blank Statement at the end of conclude, FIX THIS
